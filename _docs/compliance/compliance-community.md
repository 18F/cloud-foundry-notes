## Cloud.gov and the compliance community

Part of the mission of cloud.gov is to improve cloud adoption across the U.S. government, irrespective of vendor. In that vein, we support the FedRAMP®️ Compliance Practitioner Community of Practice, an email listserv supported by GSA's [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/).

## Charter and rules of behavior

The following is the charter for the community. Suggestions for changes are welcome, either via the listserv or as issues/pull request to [this repository](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-site). Changes to the charter are approved by cloud.gov.

> Purpose: Provide a forum for compliance staff at cloud service providers (CSPs) that are FedRAMP-authorized, or pursuing FedRAMP authorization.
>
> Membership: Open to compliance staff at CSPs listed at https://marketplace.fedramp.gov as authorized or in-process. If the CSP has retained a 3PAO to pursue authorization, they are also eligible for participation. The TTS cloud.gov compliance team will approve memberships.
>
> Access: This will be a closed list. Membership and discussions will not be published nor searchable, but will be subject to FOIA. Discussions are not deemed policy-making or advising, as the FedRAMP PMO is not participating in the listserv.
>
> Content Guidelines: 
>
> * Avoid product promotion or denigration, either your own products or other vendor's. If a product has proved useful, state how it's been useful, not that it's "Great" or "Life-changing". 
> * Respect the "closed" nature of the community: While all content could be subject to FOIA requests, do not share content with out permission of the poster.
