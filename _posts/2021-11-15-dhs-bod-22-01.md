title: "Guidance for cloud.gov customers in complying with DHS BOD 21-01"
date: November 15, 2021
excerpt: "To help ensure our customers are compliant with DHS BOD 21-01, the cloud.gov team has provided some guidance on buildpack usage and updates"

On November 3, 2021, the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published [Binding Operational Directive 22-01](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/22-01/).

In part, this BOD, "establishes a [CISA-managed catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs)](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise and establishes requirements for agencies to remediate any such vulnerabilities included in the catalog."

For cloud.gov customers, there are three responsibility realms with respect to KEVs:

* **Customer responsibility**: Ensure your application code and dependencies do not include KEVs.

* **Shared responsibility**: cloud.gov is responsible for providing “buildpacks” (container OS + language libraries) that are update regularly to be free of KEVs, but customers are responsible for regularly [re-staging their applications](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/start-restart-restage.html#restage) to use the updated buildpacks.

    - Some past buildpacks are known to include KEVs. If you have re-staged or updated your application after 2021-11-10, then you do not have any buildpack-level KEVs.
    - In the future, we will review updates to the DHS KEV list, and will notify customers when a restaging is needed to mitigate the vulnerability.

* **cloud.gov responsibility**: Ensuring the entire underlying infrastructure of our platform does not include KEVs. We do not publicly confirm nor deny our status with respect to DHS BODs, but you can open a support request for more information

PHP buildpack users: The [PHP buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases) v4.4.46 and earlier included Apache 2.4.49 and 2.4.50, which are on the KEV list. Through our release of PHP buildpack v4.4.49 on November 10, 2021, customers can address this issue by restaging their applications, which will enable PHP apps to use the updated buildpack. 

The related CVEs, [CVE-2021-41773](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41773) and [CVE-2021-42013](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42013), were not exploitable on cloud.gov unless a customer took the unusual steps of overriding the default values by customizing the configuration of the PHP buildpack, as [described more fully in the Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/php/gsg-php-config.html).
