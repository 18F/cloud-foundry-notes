On November 3, 2021, the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published [Binding Operational Directive 22-01](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/22-01/).

In part, this BOD, "establishes a [CISA-managed catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise and establishes requirements for agencies to remediate any such vulnerabilities included in the catalog.

For cloud.gov customers, an important part of using the catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities will be reviewing their existing applications running on the platform. In particular, customers will want to validate the version of the Cloud Foundry buildpack they are using and review the release notes for that buildpack version. You can view the notes for each buildpack release by using the following URL, substituting the placeholder for the buildpack type your app is using:

https://github.com/cloudfoundry/{buildpack_type}-buildpack/releases

Updates to the Cloud Foundry buildpacks, including security enhances and bug fixes, can be picked up by your application when you [restage your app](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/start-restart-restage.html#restage).
