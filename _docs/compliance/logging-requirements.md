How our system meets logging requirements specified by M-21-31.

## EL1 Requirements

### Basic Logging Categories

### Minimum Logging Data

Currently cloud.gov ensures each event log contains the data applicable for that log type. Customers are responsible for ensuring their applications log the appropriate data.

### Time Standard

Timestamps are applied to logs from all components.

### Event Forwarding

All logs are currently forwarded to a centralized ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). cloud.gov will eventually be switching over to Opensearch as the stack for centalized logging.
