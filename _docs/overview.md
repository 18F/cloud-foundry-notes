### Platform as a Service (PaaS) for government agencies

Cloud.gov allows your development team to focus on your applications. As a Platform as a Service (PaaS), Cloud.gov **eliminates the need to manage infrastructure such as virtual machines and servers**. This enables your development team to rapidly iterate and quickly launch your application to ensure mission success. Because Cloud.gov is based on **open-source technologies**, it provides portability to other cloud providers or your existing on-premise solution.

Cloud.gov is developed **by a government team** (housed within the U.S. General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Service), **for government work**.

Cloud.gov’s mission is to support agency efforts to improve the way they manage information technology. Cloud.gov helps government teams gain expertise in cloud technology, and it supports partnerships with vendors and contractors that prefer to build using cloud platforms.
