On December 13, 2020, the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published [Emergency Directive 21-01, “Mitigate SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise”](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/).

We want to assure Cloud.gov customers that the SolarWinds Orion code compromise is not applicable to Cloud.gov. There are no SolarWinds components in the Cloud.gov system.
