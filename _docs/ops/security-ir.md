# Cloud.gov Security Incident Response Guide

## Introduction

[cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) offers robust cloud solutions, including Platform as a Service (PaaS) and static website management through [cloud.gov Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/). These services are designed with security at the forefront, managed by the U.S. General Services Administrationâ€™s Technology Transformation Service to ensure rapid and secure service delivery to public agencies.

## Purpose

This guide provides an overview of our commitment to managing security incidents effectively. We prioritize the security of our platforms and the quick resolution of issues to maintain trust and integrity in our services.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you are a security researcher or a member of the public and believe you have found a security vulnerability within cloud.gov, we encourage you to report it as outlined in our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy). This policy ensures that all reports are handled responsibly and that contributions to our security are acknowledged and valued.

## Response Overview

In the event of a security incident, [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) activates a predefined response protocol:

1. **Initial Detection and Reporting:**

   - Any potential security incident identified by users or automated systems is quickly escalated to our security team via established, secure channels.

2. **Assessment:**

   - Our security team assesses the situation to determine the nature and severity of the incident. This process is crucial for prioritizing and responding appropriately.

3. **Containment and Remediation:**

   - Immediate steps are taken to contain the incident and mitigate any potential impact. The specifics of these actions depend on the severity and type of the incident.

4. **Communication:**

   - We communicate with all affected parties through official channels to ensure transparency and provide updates as required by regulatory standards.

5. **Review and Improvement:**
   - After resolving the incident, we conduct a thorough review to improve our security posture and prevent future occurrences.

## General Communication Guidelines

In the spirit of transparency, cloud.gov commits to communicating openly with our users about security incidents that may affect them, without compromising the specifics of our security practices.

## Commitment to Security

Our team is continuously trained in the latest security practices and our platforms are regularly updated to defend against evolving threats. We are dedicated to maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance.
