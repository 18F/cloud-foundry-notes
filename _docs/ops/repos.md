Cloud.gov is built and maintained by a team within the General Services administration's Technology Transformation Services (TTS), which has an [open source policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/) that guides our work: we use and develop open source software, and we encourage you to reuse and adapt our work.

Cloud.gov is an open source project based on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) with additional components built by our team and other community members. This includes using open source for security: We use a combination of [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net), [AIDE](https://aide.github.io/) and [Snort](https://www.snort.org) on each system, with [OpenZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org) to do blackbox testing.  We also run [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and a full [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) with [ElastAlert](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert) for additional monitoring and alerting. We do use a commercial tool for [CIS benchmarking](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) and further blackbox testing. We welcome you to audit our security or contribute to it â€” or to make any other kind of contribution, from documentation to design.

If you'd like to contribute security research, see our [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy).

If you're interested in contributing to Cloud.gov but not sure where to start, or if you have questions about contributing, feel free to join the [18F DevOps or open source chat channels](https://chat.18f.gov/) and explain your question. You can also open an issue with your question in a relevant repository.

To contribute to these repositories, you'll need to use [a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/), which is free to open and use. If you're part of the federal government, many agencies have approved use of public repository services such as GitHub ([some examples here](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/08/08/facts-about-publishing-open-source-code-in-government/)).
