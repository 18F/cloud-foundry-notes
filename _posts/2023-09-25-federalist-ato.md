## Cloud.gov Page’s Federalist ATO Extension for non-GSA customers

We are thrilled to announce that the current Federalist ATO has been extended until February 28th, 2024 for all current **non-GSA Cloud.gov Pages customers**. While we are excited to share this extension news with you it is crucial to emphasize that the current Federalist ATO will not, under any circumstances, be extended beyond February 28th, 2024. We understand the importance of predictability and planning for our customers and we want to ensure that you have adequate time to continue working towards obtaining your own agency specific ATO. We are continuing to research different Cloud.gov support options for customers who would like guidance or assistance in navigating the ATO process going forward and we will communicate those to customers soon. 

*For all GSA customers, GSA IT is still finalizing details on an ATO to cover GSA sites. We will provide more details as they come along*
