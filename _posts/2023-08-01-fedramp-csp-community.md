title: Announcing FedRAMP CSP Community mailing list
date: August 1, 2023
excerpt: "Email cloud-gov-compliance@gsa.gov from your CSP email to join"

Part of the mission of cloud.gov is to improve cloud adoption across the U.S. government, irrespective of vendor. In that vein, we support the FedRAMP®️ Compliance Practitioner Community of Practice, an email listserv supported by GSA's [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/).

The goal of the community is to bring together people working on FedRAMP compliance to address common questions and concerns.  We strive to maintain an inclusive, professional community that engages in on-topic discussions. The community is not associated with the FedRAMP Program Management Office.

The list is open to compliance staff at CSPs listed at [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov) as authorized or in-process, or at compliance staff at a CSP has retained a 3PAO to pursue authorization.

You can read all about this at [cloud.gov Compliance Community](({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/compliance/compliance-community.md %})), and join today by sending an email to [cloud-gov-compliance@gsa.gov](mailto:cloud-gov-compliance@gsa.gov) from the domain of your FedRAMP CSP.
