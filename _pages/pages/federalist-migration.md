      <h3>New URLs</h3>
      <p>The urls at which you access the platform will be changing to reflect our new name. No action will be required by you and you will continue to be able access the application at the old urls indefinitely, we’ll just send you on over to the new ones.</p>

    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6  usa-prose">
      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>The way you authenticate to the platform will be changing. Instead of using your Github account, you will authenticate using cloud.gov’s authentication service. In some cases, this will allow you to leverage your agency’s existing identity infrastructure, otherwise, you will use an identity service provided by cloud.gov.</p>

      <h3>Pages Organizations</h3>
      <p>The way your sites and collaborators are managed on the platform will be changing. Sites will belong to explicit organizations that correspond to your agreements and Pages Organization managers will have the ability to add and remove users from them and the platform; no more requesting access from Federalist Support!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6 usa-prose">
      <h3>Compliance and Authorization</h3>
      <p>With few exceptions, existing customers will continue to receive the GSA provided authorization for your sites for the length of your current agreement. We will be reaching out individually to those of you whose responsibilities will change prior to the expiration of your agreement.</p>
