Cloud.gov is suitable for hosting applications built on behalf of a U.S. government organization.

Customers pay for Cloud.gov through the federal Interagency Agreement (IAA/MOU) process (see [how to purchase]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/sign-up.md %})). *U.S. local, state, tribal, or territory government organizations are not able to use Cloud.gov at this time.*
 
You should have a technical person or people (employees and/or contractors) available who will manage your applications on Cloud.gov. They should be capable of [evaluating your application for suitability to Cloud.gov]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/overview/portfolio-analysis.md %}). They will need to be able to install the [Cloud.gov command line interface]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/setup.md %}) (compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux) on their client workstation to interact with Cloud.gov.
