title: Penetration and load test notification
---

If you, or a third party acting on your behalf, plan to perform a penetration test or significant load testing on your customer applications, please send the following information to [cloud.gov support]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/help/) ahead of your planned test:

```text
* Web applications or website under test: (e.g. _site_.agency.gov)
* Testing organization and contact/liaison information:
* Source IPs or IP ranges (for testers and their tools):
* Expected start date, (or starting immediately):
* Expected end date:
* Acknowledgement that you are abiding by the terms at https://cloud.gov/docs/compliance/pentest/
```

This notification is only necessary for in-depth security testing or significant load-testing, which is a common step in agency ATO processes for customer systems and in the software development lifecycle. You don't need an approval, and cloud.gov doesn't provide approvals. Simply sending the notification is sufficient. You can always run routine automated vulnerability scans on your own applications without special notification.

When arranging a security assessment or penetration test, the system under test is one of:

* _your_ application at _application-name_.app.cloud.gov, for cloud.gov Platform, or
* _your_ website at your preview URL, or your production website, for cloud.gov Pages.

In either case, do not test the cloud.gov infrastructure, such as https://pages.cloud.gov or https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov. All cloud.gov products are under regular testing by our team, and by third-party assessors, as part of our Continuous Monitoring plan. FedRAMPÂ® [makes the results available]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/overview/fedramp-tracker/#start-the-ato-process) to authorized users.

Your assessment must not target other cloud.gov customers, nor perform or simulate denial of service attacks or otherwise violate the [Amazon AWS testing policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/).
