## User Acceptance

As a new user to the platform you will be sent an invitation via email. The link in the email will take you directly to the cloud.gov login page to authenticate your credentials.  You will need to create a cloud.gov account and then use these credentials to login to Pages. 

\*Note if a user already belongs to these agencies FDIC, EPA, NIH, GSA, DOJ, OMB or has existing cloud.gov credentials they can use their existing account login information to authenticate into Pages.


  
Netlify CMS users **must** login to pages.cloud.gov prior to using the content editor.

## Who should be added

* New project team members
* Contractors
* Anyone who needs to view the organization's build logs
